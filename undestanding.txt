Strategy for each command


CommandInterpreter:

takes in input file of command list,
reads first word of string ex "Create",
passes rest of string into create strategy

uses "chain of command / responsibility" pattern to avoid large switch conditional statement:
ex, pass first word of command list to "create" command, if it is not create, move it down
